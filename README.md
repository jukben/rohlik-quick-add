# Barcode Scanner for Grocery List

Idea: Easily add products to your shopping list by scanning their barcodes.

Silly experiment with JavaScript-powered barcode scanning. Unfortunately, the PWA version consistently prompts for camera permission, even when it's already been permanently granted for the website. ðŸ¥º [Issue details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48847388/how-to-permanently-allow-usage-of-camera-on-trusted-websites-with-ios-safari/57368061#comment114386474_57368061).

It seems like there's always something to deal with when it comes to PWAs, isn't there?

Btw the barcode scanning solution I used is super slow compared to a commercial solution like this - https://strich.io/. But it kind of works. Probably not enough though to pull this through. ðŸ˜†
